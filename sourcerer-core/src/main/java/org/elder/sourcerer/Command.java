/**
 * A Command represents an operation performed on a single aggregate to update its state. Commands,
 * unlike events, can be rejected if the command is not applicable to the aggregate in its current
 * state, or the arguments passed the the command do not apply.
 * <p>
 * An instance of Command is mutable, but once configured, can be executed multiple times or delayed
 * for later execution (to support handling intermittent errors and circuit breaker patterns).
 * <p>
 * A command is at a minimum bound to a specific aggregate and operation. The Operation represents
 * the business logic performed on the aggregate to update its state. In addition, a command may
 * have additional components such as validators used to check that the given arguments are valid,
 * and constraints on the current version on an aggregate for optimistic concurrency.
 *
 * @param <TState>  The type of aggregates that the command operates on. When used with an
 *                  AggregateRepository, this should match, or be a base class of the TState type of
 *                  the repository.
 * @param <TParams> The type of parameters that the command accepts. If the commands does not accept
 *                  any parameters, use Void.
 * @param <TEvent>  The type of event that the command produces to update the aggregate if
 *                  successful. When used with an AggregateRepository, this should match, or be a
 *                  subclass of the TEvent type of the repository.
