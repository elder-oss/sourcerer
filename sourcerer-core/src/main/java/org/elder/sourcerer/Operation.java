 * An operation provides the business logic for executing a command given a state of an aggregate

 *
 * @param <TState>  The type of aggregates that the command operates on. A command intended to be
 *                  used with an AggregateRepository should have a TState type that matches, or is a
 *                  base class of, the TState type for the repository.
 * @param <TParams> The type of parameters that the command requires. If no parameters are used,
 *                  specify Void.
 * @param <TEvent>  The type of events that this command produces. A command intended to be used
 *                  with an AggregateRepository should have a TEvent type that matches, or is a
 *                  subclass of, the event type specified for the repository.
