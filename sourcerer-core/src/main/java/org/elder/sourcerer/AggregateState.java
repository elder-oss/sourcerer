/**
 * An aggregate state is a description of an aggregate (an entity constructed from events) as it
 * was created from a known state and optionally with additional modifications on top, applied in
 * the form of events.
 * <p>
 * Aggregates provide a convenient alternative to dealing with only events directly, and can be
 * used to track state changes and events as a unit. See ImmutableAggregate and MutableAggregate
 * for implementations of this interface that supports applying new events.
 * <p>
 * The aggregate state contains a log of events applied to it so far, as well as the current state
 * of the aggregate with the events applied. Until the events are explicitly persisted (manually
 * or through a command), they are only kept in-process and the aggregate state represents a
 * "dry run" result of committing the events.
 * <p>
 * A concrete aggregate is usually bound to an AggregateProjection, that provides the logic for
 * how to append the state of the aggregate given events.
 *
 * @param <TState> The type representing state of an aggregate (as relevant to the domain where it
 *                 is used).
 * @param <TEvent> The type of events that can be applied to the aggregate (in the current domain).
