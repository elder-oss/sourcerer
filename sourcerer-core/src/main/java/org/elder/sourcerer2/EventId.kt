 * Globally unique id of an event. This id does not have any defined order when compared

 * is created by the application that creates the event - not sourcerer or the dbstore engine
 * - to facilitate de-duping and idempotency. A dbstore engine _may_ choose to accept events
 * silently if the same events (as identified by the id) are attempted to be written twice to allow
 * for silent replays.
