/**
 * An aggregate is an entity constructed from events, with an id, the version it was constructed
 * from (if loaded from an existing persisted state), and a log of the events applied since loaded.
 * <p>
 * Aggregates provide a convenient alternative to dealing with events directly, and can be used to
 * track state changes and events as a unit. See ImmutableAggregate and MutableAggregate for
 * implementations of this interface that supports applying new events.
 * <p>
 * The aggregate state contains a log of events applied to it so far, as well as the current state
 * of the aggregate with the events applied. Until the events are explicitly persisted (manually or
 * through a command), they are only kept in-process and the aggregate state represents a "dry run"
 * result of committing the events.
 * <p>
 * A concrete aggregate is usually bound to an AggregateProjection, that provides the logic for how
 * to append the state of the aggregate given events.
 *
 * @param <TState> The type of the state of the aggregate.
 * @param <TEvent> The type of events that can be applied to the aggregate.
